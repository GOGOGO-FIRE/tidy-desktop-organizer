# 🧹 TidyDesktop (File Organizer)

**TidyDesktop** is a Python automation tool that instantly cleans up your messy folders.
It scans a directory and moves files into organized subfolders based on their extension (Images, Documents, Videos, etc).

## ✨ Features
* **Smart Sorting:** Categorizes files into Images, Docs, Music, Videos, Archives, etc.
* **Safe Move:** Never overwrites files! If a file exists, it renames the new one (e.g., `photo_1.jpg`).
* **Detailed Report:** Shows a summary of moved files in the terminal.

## 🚀 How to Use (For Users)

1. **Download** the script (`tidy-desktop.py`).
2. Open your terminal/command prompt.
3. Run the command:
   ```bash
   python tidy-desktop.py organize "C:/Users/You/Downloads"

Note: if shows error "Got unexpected extra arguments" Please rename your folder with  this "_".
